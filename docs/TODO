TODO [01/19/2016]
==========================================================
[1] Write the docs for descriptor_tables.c and interrupt handler

[2] REORGANIZE - move stuff to common.h in UTILS 

[3] COMMENT interupt code stuff - update notes / readme 

[4] #5 on low prio should be easy enough

==> BIG MILESTONE: got interrupts working (somewhat ) need to rework printing and come back to str utils
		now would be a good time to revisit code structure 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

[DELAYED] Str_utils are funky .. need to go through all the sizes (include and not '\0')
	[MAYBE] an issue with m_printf's len argument and how that's done
	--> Write a macro that builds 
	
[DELAYED] str_utils.h  - BACKBURNER - need memory have to do that first  not enough space
	- need functions to print integers for return val printing 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


==========================================================
LOW PRIO 
==========================================================
1. [SERIAL.c] 
	- define the flags for changing configs on serial ports 

2. Think of a good return value for print to serial 

3. [LATER WORK - @timer] A good timeout mechanism / read up more on serial port write management

5. Cursor still wonky - doesnt display after clear screen COME BACK TO IT USING JAMESMOLLOY.co.uk
