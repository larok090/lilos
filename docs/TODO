TODO 
==========================================================
*** might want to work on the delayed things for later **** 
[0] screen_write_dec / screen_write_hex move to common so we don't include io.h in main.

[1] Write the docs for descriptor_tables.c and interrupt handler

[2] REORGANIZE - move stuff to common.h in UTILS 
		- printf

[3] COMMENT interupt code stuff - update notes / readme 

[4] #5 on low prio should be easy enough
		--> Redo how write is implemented
		--> change the m_printf (and move to common.h)

[5] user space tests for string operations with no libs in C.
	[BUG] Passing a string dirrectly to screen_write crashes literally everything ex. screen_write("Hello World")

[6] Move on to IRQ and user mode 

==========================================================
LOW PRIO 
==========================================================
1. REDO MAKEFILE split across all folders to have one that is triggered ? TO make it easier to change small things and
	have one main make 
	[Downside] Harder to track dependencies .. might need a dependance graph

2. Draw quick diagrams / update IO diagram for the OS -- Take that as a lesson for design.. not so good to have to refactor on every module

3. [LATER WORK - @timer] A good timeout mechanism / read up more on serial port write management

4. io.c - FIX WRITE - doesnt quite do it right ... not nul terminated string -- come back later low prio??

==========================================================
DELAYED
==========================================================

[DELAYED] Str_utils are funky .. need to go through all the sizes (include and not '\0')
	[MAYBE] an issue with m_printf's len argument and how that's done
	--> Write a macro that builds 
	
[DELAYED] str_utils.h  - BACKBURNER - need memory have to do that first  not enough space
	- need functions to print integers for return val printing 


==========================================================
DONE
==========================================================
[V] Make type declarations uniform (io.h/io.c/serial.c/descriptors/isr/log/str_util done) 

[V] In common.h I need a memcpy function alongside the memset

[V] io.c - FIX WRITE - doesnt quite do it right ... not nul terminated string -- come back later low prio??
		-- Scroll works .. just going to leave the non-null term string thing for later

==> BIG MILESTONE: got interrupts working (somewhat ) need to rework printing and come back to str utils
		now would be a good time to revisit code structure
