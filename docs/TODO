TODO [01/19/2016]
==========================================================

[V] Make type declarations uniform (io.h/io.c/serial.c/descriptors/isr/log/str_util done) 

[1] Write the docs for descriptor_tables.c and interrupt handler

[2] REORGANIZE - move stuff to common.h in UTILS 

[3] COMMENT interupt code stuff - update notes / readme 

[4] #5 on low prio should be easy enough
		--> Redo how write is implemented
		--> change the m_printf

==> BIG MILESTONE: got interrupts working (somewhat ) need to rework printing and come back to str utils
		now would be a good time to revisit code structure 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

[DELAYED] Str_utils are funky .. need to go through all the sizes (include and not '\0')
	[MAYBE] an issue with m_printf's len argument and how that's done
	--> Write a macro that builds 
	
[DELAYED] str_utils.h  - BACKBURNER - need memory have to do that first  not enough space
	- need functions to print integers for return val printing 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


==========================================================
LOW PRIO 
==========================================================
1. REDO MAKEFILE split across all folders to have one that is triggered ? TO make it easier to change small things and
	have one main make 
	[Downside] Harder to track dependencies .. might need a dependance graph

2. Draw quick diagrams / update IO diagram for the OS -- Take that as a lesson for design.. not so good to have to refactor on every module

3. [LATER WORK - @timer] A good timeout mechanism / read up more on serial port write management
