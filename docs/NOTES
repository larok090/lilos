.OS DESIGN NOTES:

1. ENTRY PT FOR OS ADDRESS
	- loader file in NASM assembler
	- nasm -f elf32 loader.s
	- need flags for multiboot, magic number, and checksum
		 MAGIC_NUMBER 	equ	0x1BADBOO2
		 FLAG		equ 	0x0
		 CHECKSUM	equ	-MAGIC_NUMBER

2. Framebuffer - hardware device capable of displaying a buffer of memory on the screen.
		- has 80 columns and 25 rows 
		- row and olumn indices start at 0

	=> It is memory mapped
	=> Starting addres @: 0x000B800
	
	Bit:     | 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 | 7 6 5 4 | 3 2 1 0 |
	Content: | ASCII                 | FG      | BG      |
	
	ASCII: the character to print
	FG: Foreground color - val 0 -15 
	BG: Background color - val 0 - 15 //same colors as for foreground

3. Moving cursor (on the framebuffer)

	-Done via 2 different I/O ports.
	- Position determined with a 16 bit int, 0 => row 0 col 0
						 1 => row 0 col 1
					  	 80 => row 1 col 0 //wrapped around (so i % 80 = col, i = row)

	Position is 16 bits but 'out' assembly instr arg is 8 bits ===> need to send instr in 2 turns
								   ===> first 8 bits then the rest 8 bits

	2 Ports:   
			describes the data @: 0x3D4
			data itself @: 0x3D5

	example of setting cursor to row 1 col 0 (aka pos 80 = 0x0050 ) note this cant be done in C (out instr is not available)

		out 0x3D4, 14		;14 tells framebuffer to expect the highest 8 bits of the position (to the describe port)
		out 0x3D5, 0x00		; sending highest 8 bits of 0x0050 -> 0x00; (to the data port)
		out 0x3d4, 15		; 15 tells the fb to expect the lowest 8 bits of position
		out 0x3D5, 0x50		; the low 8 bits of 0x0050 => 0x50;



4. Serial ports /* INCOMPLETE */


Each port is refered to as a COM port (currently my code has defined addresses for COM1 and COM2 [12/12/15 O.B])

To send or recieve we need to set the BAUD rate for a port
==================================================================================================================
BAUD rate: Speed at which the serial line switches between its two states (send / recieve). 
			This is not equivalent to bits/s because in serial transmission there is a start and a stop bit 
			[on an  8/N/1 line 10 baud = 1 byte ]
==================================================================================================================

Each COM port has a set of registers (1 and 0) (for uselOS its 8 bit registers)
In reality they are just bits of an address space 
	- these are MACRO DEFINED in serial.c file [12/12/15 O.B] 

regs 0 and 1 depend on the setting of DLAB (divisor latch access bit)
when DLAB = 0
offset 0 : data register (read from recieve buffer, write to transmit buffer)
offset 1 : Interrupt enable register /* read more on this IRQ lines or just serial stuff*/

DLAB = 1
offset 0: least significant byte of divisor for BAUD rate
offset 1: most significant byte of divisor for BAUD rate

REST of offsets (that are defined for uselOS [12/12/15 O.B])
